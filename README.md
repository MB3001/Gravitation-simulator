# Gravitation-simulator
Very very simple, buggy and inefficient gravitation simulator. My first game in JMonkey Engine.
You can move with 'ASDW' and shoot balls with left click.
This will make life easier for those who want to create games set in space, astronomical and scientific simulations, teach physics by giving the program educational applications or simply have a good time playing and improving it through programming in JMonkey engine.

You can play it directly by opening MyGame.jar in the "dist" folder.

It is built with JMonkey engine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
