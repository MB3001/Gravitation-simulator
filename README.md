# Gravitation-simulator
Very very simple, buggy and inefficient gravitation simulator. My first game in JMonkey Engine.
You can move with 'ASDW' and shoot balls with left click.

You can play it directly by opening MyGame.jar in the "dist" folder.

It is built with JMonkey engine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
